# Ultra-Low-Noise-Power-Supply
Ultra-Low Noise, Ultra-High PSRR +/-12V DC/DC with LT3045 & LT3094  
  
#### +/-12V Power Supply Reference Board / Evaluation Board for High-Precision, Ultra-Low Noise Analog Circuits  
  
The 12V output low-noise p-n power Mpression Ultra-Low Noise, Ultra-High PSRR +/-12V DC/DC Board with LT3045 is a low-noise (0.8µVRMS at 10Hz to 100kHz) reference board for audio equipment and small-signal sensor systems.  
  
Audio equipment designs require low noise power supply to improve audio quality, and small-signal sensor processing circuits like in CCD sensors require low-noise positive and negative power supplies for analog circuitry.  
  
This reference board is designed using two Analog Devices linear regulators: LT3045 for the positive side linear regulator, and LT3094 for the negative side linear regulator - both with ultra-low noise (0.8µVRMS at 10Hz to 100kHz) and ultra-high PSRR, perfect for high-precision analog circuits.  
  
#### LT3045  
* Wide Input Voltage Range: 1.8V to 20V
* Ultra-high PSRR: 76dB (1MHz)
* Output Current: 500mA
* Reverse-Battery and Reverse-Current Protection  
  
#### LT3094  
* Wide Input Voltage Range: -1.8V to -20V
* Ultra-high PSRR: 74dB (1MHz)
* Output Current: 500mA
* Output Voltage Range: 0V to -19.5V

### Specifications:  
* Input Voltage 	12.5V to 20V / -20V to -12.5V
* Output Voltage 	+/-12V
* Output Current 	Max 500 mA  (depends on input/output difference and output current)
